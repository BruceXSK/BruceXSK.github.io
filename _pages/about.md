Hello! My name is Shikuan Xie. I am a third-year Master's student at [Visual, Sensing and Intelligent System Laboratory](http://www.vsislab.com/), School of Control Science and Engineering of Shandong University(SDU), advised by Prof. Wei Zhang. 
My research interest mainly lies in robotics and deep learning.
Currently I'm working on robot perception (especially based on LiDAR) and navigation.
