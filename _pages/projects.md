- The network output control comand by encoding the features of laser, goal and speed.
- We trained the network based on online reinforcement learning algorithm PPO.
- The runtime code is written in C++ and deployed on Nvidia TX2.
- Some security protection strategies and traditional path planning algorithms are combined to solve some corner cases that reinforcement learning cannot handle.
